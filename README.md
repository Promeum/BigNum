# BigNum

A BigNum with Fractions implementation for big-integer calculations, including a BigMath module.

This is a fork of [RoStrap's BigNum library](https://github.com/RoStrap/Math) and includes my personal additions to BigNum and a new BigMath module, which just pipes BigNums through the built-in math module.

The BigMath module has all the functions described in the [Roblox math module](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/libraries/math). See the Roblox-provided documentation for further information on those functions.
